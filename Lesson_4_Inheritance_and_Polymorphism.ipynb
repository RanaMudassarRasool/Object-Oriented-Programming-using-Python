        "Inheritance and polymorphism are important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allow for code reuse and flexibility in designing classes and objects. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, while polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be used interchangeably.\n",

        "Topics covered in this lesson include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Inheritance: Understanding how one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, and the different types of inheritance such as single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multi-level inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Overriding and super(): Overriding methods in a subclass to provide customized behavior, and using the super() function to call overridden methods from the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism: Understanding how objects of different classes can be treated as if they were of the same class, allowing for flexibility and extensibility in designing classes and objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstract classes and interfaces: Using abstract classes and interfaces to define common behavior that must be implemented by subclasses, and understanding the difference between abstract classes and regular classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method resolution order (MRO): Understanding how Python resolves method calls in case of multiple inheritance, and using the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the order of method resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Method overloading and method overriding: Understanding the concepts of method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters are defined in a class, and method overriding, where a subclass provides a new implementation for a method already defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphic methods: Creating methods that can accept different types of objects as arguments, allowing for flexibility and interoperability in code.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Diamond problem: Understanding the issue of the diamond problem in multiple inheritance and how it can be resolved using method resolution order and **super()** function.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using inheritance and polymorphism in real-world scenarios: Applying the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in practical examples, such as modeling real-world entities like vehicles, animals, and employees using OOP principles.\n",

        "# Understanding inheritance and its types in Python\n",
        "Inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, known as the parent or base class. This allows for code reuse and promotes code organization and maintenance. In Python, there are five types of inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Single Inheritance**: In this type of inheritance, a class inherits from a single parent class. The child class inherits all the attributes and methods of the parent class, and can also override or extend them.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multiple Inheritance:** In this type of inheritance, a class can inherit from more than one parent class. The child class inherits attributes and methods from all the parent classes, and can override or extend them. However, multiple inheritance can lead to method name conflicts and requires careful handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Multi-level Inheritance**: In this type of inheritance, a class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class. This creates a hierarchical chain of inheritance, allowing for code reuse and organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: In this type of inheritance, multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class. This allows for code reuse and sharing of attributes and methods among related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hybrid Inheritance**: This is a combination of two or more types of inheritance. For example, a class can inherit from multiple parent classes and also have child classes that inherit from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Understanding the different types of inheritance in Python is important for designing and implementing efficient and organized classes and objects in your OOP programs. Proper use of inheritance can result in clean, maintainable, and extensible code, while improper use can lead to method name conflicts, code duplication, and other issues."

        "\n",

        "It's important to note that the order in which multiple parent classes are specified in the child class matters. Python uses Method Resolution Order (MRO) to determine which method to call when there are method name conflicts in multiple inheritance. The MRO is determined by the order of inheritance, which can be changed using the super() function. Proper understanding of MRO is crucial when dealing with multiple inheritance in Python"

        "\n",
        "1. Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from its parent class. It promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes with shared characteristics.\n",
        "2. There are different types of inheritance in Python, such as single inheritance (where a class inherits from only one parent class), multiple inheritance (where a class inherits from more than one parent class), and multi-level inheritance (where a class inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class).\n",
        "3. Methods and attributes of a parent class can be overridden in the child class, allowing for customization and specialization in inherited classes.\n",
        "4. Polymorphism is a powerful concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. It promotes code flexibility and abstraction.\n",
        "5. Polymorphism in Python is achieved through duck typing, where the type of an object is determined at runtime based on its behavior, rather than its class or type.\n",
        "6. Method Resolution Order (MRO) is the order in which Python looks for methods in a class hierarchy. It follows a specific algorithm called C3 linearization, which determines the order in which parent classes' methods are called in case of multiple inheritance.\n",
        "7. Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, enabling the reuse of code from multiple sources. However, it requires careful consideration of method resolution order and potential conflicts.\n",
        "8. Inheritance and polymorphism are powerful tools in object-oriented programming that promote code reuse, flexibility, and abstraction, leading to efficient and maintainable code.\n",
        "9. Understanding the different types of inheritance, overriding methods and attributes, and implementing polymorphism are essential skills for writing efficient and extensible object-oriented Python code.\n",
        "10. In conclusion, mastering the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in Python opens up a wide range of possibilities for designing flexible and scalable applications, and it is a fundamental aspect of advanced Python programming"
